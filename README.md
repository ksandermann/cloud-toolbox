# cloud-toolbox
Docker Image to work with Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Openshift, Helm, Ansible, Terraform and HashiCorp Vault.
It's the toolchain I'm working with on a daily basis, packed into a docker image with both zsh and bash to have a
platform-independent development environment.
Feel free to use/share/contribute.

# default shell & custom startup-script
The default shell is sh.
However, the CMD step inside the Dockerfile points to /bin/bash.
By default, the file .autoexec.sh will be mounted into the container and sourced inside both bash and zsh.

# run.sh
The behaviour of run.sh is as follows:
1. check if there is already a running toolbox.
1. if so, attach to the container and start a new shell (/bin/bash) inside it.
1. if not, pull latest tag and start a new interactive container and start a new shell (/bin/zsh) inside it.

# custom ca certificates`
All CAs placed inside ```~/ca-certificates``` on the host system will be mounted into the container and trusted on startup.

# helm 3 and terraform 0.13/0.14
While a lot of projects are upgrading to helm 3, helm 2 will probably still be around for some time.
As helm 3 does not provide backward-compatibility, both versions are installed in parallel in cloud-toolbox.
Helm 2 can be used as before to provide backward-compatibility, helm 3 can be used via binary `helm3`.
The same pattern applies to terraform 0.12 and 0.14 - 0.12 can be used via binary `terraform`, while 0.14 is available via binary `terraform14`.

# versioning
Release tags will be build following pattern YYYY-MM-dd-version.
Version 01 of a date will always contain the latest stable/official versions of tooling available.
Other versions of a date can contain version combinations of the toolchain and will be documented in the version history
below.
